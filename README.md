# Running Test Cases
Test cases have been written using Laravel‚Äôs built-in PestPHP / PHPUnit testing framework. To execute the tests, follow these steps:

## Run All Tests:
   ```bash
   php artisan test --env=testing
   ```
## Run Specific Test File (Recommended for Task Review):
   ```bash
   php artisan test --filter=TimeTrackerTest --env=testing
   ```
This will run only the tests inside `tests/Feature/TimeTrackerTest.php`.

# Test Cases Covered:
1. **User can add a time log**

- Validates that a user can successfully add a time log entry.
- User cannot log more than 10 hours per day
- Ensures that a user is restricted from logging more than 10 hours of time entries for a single day.
- The test will assert a validation failure with appropriate error messages.

# Additional Notes
- No UI/frontend changes are required for this task.
- All validations are handled via backend logic.
- You can adjust the test data inside TimeTrackerTest.php if needed for further scenarios.
